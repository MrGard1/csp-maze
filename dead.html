    <p>
      You find yourself in a dark void, disoriented and bewildered. One moment,
      you were bravely exploring the secrets of Blackwood Manor, and the next,
      everything went dark. How did it come to this? Did you misstep, or was it
      something lurking in the shadows that claimed you? The echoes of your
      choices swirl around you, but clarity eludes you. Your adventure has come
      to an abrupt end, and the haunting memories of the manor will forever
      haunt your thoughts.
